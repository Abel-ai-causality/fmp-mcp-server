# Financial Modeling Prep MCP Server - Implementation Summary

## Overview

We have successfully implemented a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that provides tools, resources, and prompts for financial analysis using the Financial Modeling Prep API. This implementation follows a Test-Driven Development (TDD) approach, where we first wrote tests defining the expected behavior and then implemented the functionality to pass those tests.

## Key Components

### API Client Layer

The API client layer (`src/api/client.py`) provides a reusable function for making requests to the FMP API. It includes:

- API key management
- Error handling for HTTP errors, request errors, and other exceptions
- Asynchronous operation using `httpx`

### Tools Implementation

Tools (`src/tools/`) provide functions that can be invoked by LLMs through the MCP server:

1. **Company Tools** (`company.py`):
   - Company profiles
   - Financial statements (income statement, balance sheet, cash flow)

2. **Market Tools** (`market.py`):
   - Stock quotes
   - Market indexes
   - Stock news
   - Historical prices
   - Stock searches

3. **Analysis Tools** (`analysis.py`):
   - Financial ratios
   - Key financial metrics

### Resources Implementation

Resources (`src/resources/`) provide data that can be accessed by LLMs:

1. **Company Resources** (`company.py`):
   - Stock information
   - Financial statements
   - Peer companies
   - Price targets

2. **Market Resources** (`market.py`):
   - Market snapshots with index and sector data

### Prompt Templates

Prompt templates (`src/prompts/templates.py`) provide reusable analysis patterns:

- Company analysis
- Financial statement analysis
- Stock comparison
- Market outlook
- Investment idea generation
- Technical analysis
- Economic indicator analysis

### Main Server Implementation

The main server (`src/server.py`) integrates all components and exposes them via the MCP protocol. It:

- Configures the server with metadata
- Registers tools, resources, and prompts
- Handles protocol interactions

## Testing

The test suite (`tests/`) covers:

1. **API Client Tests**:
   - Successful requests
   - Error handling

2. **Tools Tests**:
   - Functionality verification
   - Error handling

3. **Resources Tests**:
   - URI pattern handling
   - Data formatting

4. **Prompts Tests**:
   - Template generation
   - Parameter handling

5. **Server Integration Tests**:
   - Component registration
   - End-to-end verification

## Next Steps

1. **Complete Test Coverage**:
   - Finish implementing all tests
   - Add more edge case testing

2. **Feature Extensions**:
   - Add more financial analysis tools
   - Improve resource caching
   - Add authentication handling

3. **Deployment**:
   - Create containerized deployment
   - Set up CI/CD pipeline

4. **Documentation**:
   - Add inline code documentation
   - Create user guide

## Conclusion

This implementation demonstrates how MCP can be used to expose financial data and analysis capabilities to LLMs in a structured way. By following TDD practices, we've created a robust and maintainable codebase that can be extended with additional features in the future.

# FMP MCP Server - Historical Commodity Price Data Addition (April 19, 2025)

## Session Summary

In this session, we enhanced the Financial Modeling Prep MCP Server with a new function for retrieving historical commodity price data. This feature allows users to access historical price information for commodities using the FMP API endpoint `historical-price-eod/light`.

## Key Accomplishments

1. **Implemented Historical Price EOD Light Function**
   - Created `get_historical_price_eod_light` function in `src/tools/commodities.py`
   - Added support for required `symbol` parameter and optional `limit`, `from_date`, and `to_date` parameters
   - Implemented daily price change and percentage change calculations
   - Formatted output as a Markdown table with emoji indicators for price movements
   - Added comprehensive error handling and parameter validation

2. **Added Comprehensive Tests**
   - Created unit tests in `tests/test_commodities.py` following TDD principles
   - Added acceptance test in `tests/acceptance_tests.py` to verify integration with the real API
   - Added mock response data in `tests/conftest.py` for testing in TEST_MODE
   - Ensured all tests pass successfully

3. **Integrated with Server**
   - Updated imports in `src/server.py`
   - Registered the new function as a tool
   - Verified proper registration and availability

4. **Updated Documentation**
   - Added information about the new function to README.md
   - Created a detailed summary document (summary_get_historical_price_eod_light.md)

## Function Implementation Details

The `get_historical_price_eod_light` function provides:

- Historical price data for commodities (e.g., gold, silver, oil)
- Optional filtering by date range using `from_date` and `to_date` parameters
- Optional limiting of results using the `limit` parameter
- Calculation of daily price changes and percentage changes
- Well-formatted Markdown output with emoji indicators (ðŸ”º, ðŸ”», âž–) for price movements

Example output:
```markdown
# Historical Price Data for GCUSD
*Data as of 2025-04-19 15:30:22*
From: 2025-01-31 To: 2025-02-04

| Date | Price | Volume | Daily Change | Daily Change % |
|------|-------|--------|-------------|----------------|
| 2025-02-04 | 2,873.7 | 137,844 | ðŸ”º 8.5 | ðŸ”º 0.3% |
| 2025-02-03 | 2,865.2 | 142,563 | ðŸ”º 7.7 | ðŸ”º 0.27% |
| 2025-02-02 | 2,857.5 | 134,912 | ðŸ”º 7.2 | ðŸ”º 0.25% |
| 2025-02-01 | 2,850.3 | 129,876 | ðŸ”º 8.2 | ðŸ”º 0.29% |
| 2025-01-31 | 2,842.1 | 145,332 | N/A | N/A |
```

## Next Steps

Potential future enhancements could include:

- Adding additional historical data functions for other asset types
- Adding more data visualization tools for historical data
- Implementing technical indicators based on the historical data
- Adding comparing historical price data across multiple commodities

# FMP MCP Server - Chat Agent Addition (April 14, 2025)

## Session Summary

In this session, we enhanced the Financial Modeling Prep MCP Server with a new chat agent feature, allowing users to interact with financial data tools through a natural language interface. 

## Key Accomplishments

1. **Created Agent Chat Client**

   - Configured the agent to connect to the FMP MCP Server via SSE (Server-Sent Events)
   - Added support for OpenAI trace view for debugging agent operations

2. **Updated Project Dependencies**
   - Added required dependencies to support the chat agent:
     - openai>=1.73.0
     - openai-agents>=0.0.9
     - rich>=13.7.0
   - Updated both `requirements.txt` and `pyproject.toml` files

3. **Updated Documentation**
   - Enhanced README.md with detailed information about the new chat agent feature
   - Added setup and usage instructions
   - Included configuration details for OpenAI API key
   - Added examples of the chat agent in action

## Client Implementation Details

The agent chat client (`src/agent_chat_client.py`) provides:

- Interactive command-line interface for querying financial data
- Connection to the FMP MCP server via SSE protocol
- Access to all FMP financial tools through natural language
- Clean conversation flow with exit commands
- OpenAI trace view support for debugging agent behavior

```python
# Core functionality of the chat loop
async def run(mcp_server: MCPServer):
    agent = Agent(
        name="Assistant",
        instructions="Use the tools to answer the questions.",
        mcp_servers=[mcp_server],
        model_settings=ModelSettings(tool_choice="required"),
    )

    while True:
        user_input = input("\nYou: ")
        if user_input.lower() in ["exit", "quit"]:
            print("Assistant: Goodbye!")
            break
        print(f"Running: {user_input}")
        result = await Runner.run(starting_agent=agent, input=user_input)
        print(result.final_output)
```

## Usage Instructions

1. Start the FMP MCP server in SSE mode:
   ```bash
   python -m src.server --sse
   ```

2. Set up OpenAI API key:
   ```bash
   export OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
   ```

3. Run the chat agent:
   ```bash
   python src/agent_chat_client.py
   ```

4. Interact with the agent using natural language:
   ```
   You: What is the current price of Apple?
   Running: What is the current price of Apple?
   The current price of Apple Inc. (AAPL) is $202.52.
   ```

5. Type `exit` or `quit` to end the session.

## Next Steps

Potential future enhancements could include:

- Adding conversation memory for more contextual responses
- Implementing richer formatting for financial data display
- Supporting batch analysis requests
- Adding visualization capabilities for chart data
- Creating a web interface for the chat agent
