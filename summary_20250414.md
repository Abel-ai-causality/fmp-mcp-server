# FMP MCP Server - Chat Agent Addition (April 14, 2025)

## Session Summary

In this session, we enhanced the Financial Modeling Prep MCP Server with a new chat agent feature, allowing users to interact with financial data tools through a natural language interface. 

## Key Accomplishments

1. **Created Agent Chat Client**
   - Implemented `agent_chat_client.py` using OpenAI's Agents SDK
   - Built an interactive CLI interface with chat loop functionality
   - Configured the agent to connect to the FMP MCP Server via SSE (Server-Sent Events)
   - Added support for OpenAI trace view for debugging agent operations

2. **Updated Project Dependencies**
   - Added required dependencies to support the chat agent:
     - openai>=1.73.0
     - openai-agents>=0.0.9
     - rich>=13.7.0
   - Updated both `requirements.txt` and `pyproject.toml` files

3. **Updated Documentation**
   - Enhanced README.md with detailed information about the new chat agent feature
   - Added setup and usage instructions
   - Included configuration details for OpenAI API key
   - Added examples of the chat agent in action

## Client Implementation Details

The agent chat client (`src/agent_chat_client.py`) provides:

- Interactive command-line interface for querying financial data
- Connection to the FMP MCP server via SSE protocol
- Access to all FMP financial tools through natural language
- Clean conversation flow with exit commands
- OpenAI trace view support for debugging agent behavior

```python
# Core functionality of the chat loop
async def run(mcp_server: MCPServer):
    agent = Agent(
        name="Assistant",
        instructions="Use the tools to answer the questions.",
        mcp_servers=[mcp_server],
        model_settings=ModelSettings(tool_choice="required"),
    )

    while True:
        user_input = input("\nYou: ")
        if user_input.lower() in ["exit", "quit"]:
            print("Assistant: Goodbye!")
            break
        print(f"Running: {user_input}")
        result = await Runner.run(starting_agent=agent, input=user_input)
        print(result.final_output)
```

## Usage Instructions

1. Start the FMP MCP server in SSE mode:
   ```bash
   python -m src.server --sse
   ```

2. Set up OpenAI API key:
   ```bash
   export OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
   ```

3. Run the chat agent:
   ```bash
   python src/agent_chat_client.py
   ```

4. Interact with the agent using natural language:
   ```
   You: What is the current price of Apple?
   Running: What is the current price of Apple?
   The current price of Apple Inc. (AAPL) is $202.52.
   ```

5. Type `exit` or `quit` to end the session.

## Next Steps

Potential future enhancements could include:

- Adding conversation memory for more contextual responses
- Implementing richer formatting for financial data display
- Supporting batch analysis requests
- Adding visualization capabilities for chart data
- Creating a web interface for the chat agent
